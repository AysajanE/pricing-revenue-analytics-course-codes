    "The Littlewood's rule assumes two product classes (e.g.,full- and discount-fare airline tickets, full- and discount-rate for hotel rooms, etc.) with associated prices $p_f$ and $p_d$, where $p_f > p_d$. The capacity is $C$. We ignore calcellations, no-shows, and overbooking. $D_f$ and $D_d$ denote demands for full-fare and discount-fare, respectively. The demand is a random variable with distribution $F_f$ and $F_d$."

    "The problem we are trying to solve is to determine how much discount class demand to accept before seeing the realization of full class demand. Why is this the case? In general hotel, airline bookings exihibit similar patterns: demands for discount class arrive first in the booking horizon and demands for the full class arrive later. This is because of two very different customer segments: leisure travelers and business travelers. Their characteristics determine such an interesting arrival pattern. Leisure travelers are price sensitive and tend to book well in advance whereas business travelers are relatively less price sensitive (afterall they are not paying for the ticket or room) and tend to book much closer to the service date.

    "With those characteristics, the problem for the company is to determine how much discount class demand to accept before realizing full class demand. What happens if they don't evalaute it carefully? Let's imagine two scenarios:\n",
    "- Booking limit for the discount class is too low. In this situation, more rooms reserved for late-arriving full class business customers. But if the full class demand is not strong, then the airplane will take off with more empty seats. They could have sold it to the discount class early on when the booking requests arrive. So this causes __spoilage__. Once the airplane take off, the empty seats are spoiled because airlines cannot store it and save for later days.\n",
    "- Booking limie for the discount class is too high. In htis situation, less rooms are reserved for the late-arriving high paying business class. If the business demand is strong, since they sell too many rooms upfront for the discount class, they forgo the higher revenue they could have earned if they had enough seats for business class. This causes dilution because airlines earn lower price instead of higher price.\n",

    "- If we do not accept it, we are hoping that we could sell it to the higher paying class. But it is not guaranteed.
