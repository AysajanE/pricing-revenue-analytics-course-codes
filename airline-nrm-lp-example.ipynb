    "## Example\n",
    "Consider a simple [hub-and-spoke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoke%E2%80%93hub_distribution_paradigm) airline network where an airline offers two flights:\n",
    "\n",
    "San Francisco (SFO) ----------> Denver (DEN) ----------------> St. Louis (STL)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Flight 1*: SFO ---> DEN\n",
    "\n",
    "*Flight 2*: DEV ---> STL\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these two flights, the airline can create three products:\n",
    "- San Francisco to Denver flight\n",
    "- Denver to St. Louis flight\n",
    "- San Francisco to St. Louis flight\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially an airline product is simply an origin-destination combination. For each product, the airline can offer different fare classes, like full fare, discount fare, and deep discount fare, where in general the price is getting lower and lower, respectively. For this example, we assume that this airline offers full fare and discount fare. Accoridngly, the airline can sell six types of flight tickets to the customers:\n",
    "1. SFO ---> DEV full fare\n",
    "2. SFO ---> DEV discount fare\n",
    "3. DEV ---> STL full fare\n",
    "4. DEV ---> STL discount fare\n",
    "5. SFO ---> STL full fare\n",
    "6. SFO ---> STL discount fare\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination of product and fare class is called *origin-destination fare class*, or ODF in traditional revenue management. Several ket facts about those ODFs:\n",
    "- Each ODF is a combination of product and fare class.\n",
    "- Each ODF has an associated demand. Demands are observed in the ODF level.\n",
    "- Airline fares are priced at ODF level.\n",
    "- Each ODF consumes one or multiple resources. For instance, SFO ---> DEV full fare consumes one seat from SFO ---> DEV flight; SFO ---> STL discount fare consumes one flight seat from each of the SFO ---> DEV flight and DEV --> STL flight.\n",

    "The way airline bookings works is that consumers make advance purchase requests on an upcoming flight and airlines make decisions on accepting or rejecting those advance purchases. The tradeoff airlies face is that if they accept a request with discount fare, it might dislace a potential full fare request in the future. Also, if a customer wants to book a fligt that spans multiple legs, it is essentially consuming multiple legs. For airlines the revenue from such booking is lower than the sum of the fare they can collect by selling each resource individually to local booking requests. For instance, airlines might accept a SFo ---> STL booking request for 300.00 dollars where they could have sold two separate single-leg local flights for a total of 350 dollars, 200.00 for the first flight and 150.00 for the second flight. This means lost revenue for the airline.\n",
